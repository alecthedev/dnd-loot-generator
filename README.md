### Summary

This is a Dungeons and Dragons Loot Generation Program that allows users to type in how many items they would like to generate. The program then pulls items from Open5e, a [5th edition API](https://api.open5e.com/), and displays the information of the items generated to the user.

Items may be filtered by type and the generation of items can be weighted by rarity. Users may also bring in their own items through a homebrew item creation system. :)

### Running the tests

Navigate to Gradle's task directory and find the "test" task under the "verification" subdirectory. Double-click to run this task.
